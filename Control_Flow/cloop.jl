"""
    Use the syntax @cloop begin (init; update; end_cond) body end. 
    This loop will leak any variables in the init expr into its surrounding scope.
    However, everything else will remain in a separate local scope.
    Perhaps in the future I will add something to detect whether the variable is already initialized; 
    If it is then it behaves as now, modifying that variable, but if it isn't allocated then its in a local scope and so does not leak 
    If @cloop is used in the global scope, any changes to variables created in init in the body 
    must be annotated with global
